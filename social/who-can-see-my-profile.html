  Anybody who knows your username can see your profile by visiting either http://preserve.io/user/USERNAME or http://preserve.io/u/USERNAME
</p>

<p>
  We currently don't have a published list of usernames on the site, so unless you let people know that your username is puppylover69, there's a good chance nobody will stumble across your profile.
</p>

<p>
  The only way that somebody could get to your profile without knowing your Preserve username is the off chance that they guess that you've got a Preserve account, and know that you use the same username across all services.

  <b>NOTE:</b> There are currently NO profile privacy settings, however it is planned. When they are in place, this page will be updated.
