  Preserve is currently invite only to make sure that we can handle all of the users who'd like to use the site, without sacrificing the performance or reliability of the site.
</p>

<p>
  By only allowing a limited number of users into the site at a given time, we can make sure that when the site finally does launch publicly it can handle all of the traffic, indexing, and scraping it will need to do.
